# Enable data access and streaming from EDG Datalake
> Enable near real-time data streaming and enhanced data access capabilities from EDG Datalake to support improved KPI functionality and customer management

## Business Context
In 2025, EDG will have streaming KPI functionality between EDG and FMCC. Currently, data latency between these systems limits real-time insights and operational efficiency. Additionally, LPM has limited access to comprehensive data sets from FMCC, which restricts our ability to effectively manage new customers independently and utilize richer data sources for enhanced analytics.

## Epic Goal
Enable near real-time data streaming from EDG Datalake while providing LPM with enhanced data access capabilities to independently manage customers and leverage expanded data sets for improved operational insights.

## User Impact
- Primary users: LPM operations team, data analysts, customer onboarding teams
- Current experience: Dependency on Metrics team for TDR feed generation (1-3 month backlog), limited data access with hourly/daily latency, restricted data sets
- Desired experience: Self-service customer TDR provisioning with no external dependencies, near real-time data insights, access to comprehensive data including Sipreq stanza for enhanced analytics

## Scope
### Key Features & Capabilities
- Implement near real-time data streaming from EDG Datalake
- Establish enhanced data access permissions and capabilities from FMCC
- Build support for independent customer management within LPM
- Enable access to expanded data sets (including Sipreq stanza)
- Integrate streaming KPI functionality between EDG and FMCC

### Out of Scope
- TDR audit records (will remain in existing flat-file workflows for this implementation)
- Migration of other existing flat-file based data ingestion workflows to streaming (only TDR data)
- Other data sources beyond base TDR data from EDG Datalake

## Success Metrics
- TDR data latency: Hourly/Daily SFTP flat files → Sub-minute streaming (target: <60 seconds, stretch goal: <15 seconds)
- Data freshness: Batch processing → Near real-time continuous streaming
- Customer onboarding time: 1-3 months (Metrics team dependency) → Same-day self-service provisioning

## Dependencies & Constraints
- Systems impacted: EDG Datalake, FMCC, LPM, Databricks
- External dependencies: EDG streaming KPI functionality completion in 2025
- Technical constraints: 
  - First streaming integration for LPM (all current workflows are flat-file based)
  - Unknown Databricks feature requirements and availability in Intrado's instance
  - Need to develop new streaming data ingestion patterns vs. existing file parsing workflows
- Business constraints: [Need to identify]

## Initial Story / Task Breakdown
1. Assess current data access capabilities and limitations
2. Design streaming architecture for EDG to LPM data flow
3. Implement filtered streaming of TDR data using [mechanism TBD]
7. Testing and validation of near real-time data flows
8. Documentation for new streaming capabilities

## Risks & Assumptions
- Assumption: EDG streaming KPI functionality will be completed as planned in 2025
- Assumption: Required Databricks features will be available in Intrado's instance
- Risk: First streaming implementation may face significant learning curve and technical complexity
- Risk: Data access permissions may require extensive coordination with FMCC teams
- Risk: Existing flat-file based architecture may require substantial refactoring to support streaming
- Risk: Unknown Databricks feature requirements could impact timeline or feasibility
- Risk: Sub-minute latency targets may not be achievable without significant infrastructure investment

A ESPOSRSP TDR Audit feed was requested under SBR-1784 from the Metrics team.  This effort is complete and the daily files are being uploaded to the LPM MoveIT account.  The ESPOSRSP file is in CSV format and has the following columns:
    ctid
    trid
    comm_ts
    rmtne_type
    rmtne_systemid
    transid
    position_latitude
    position_longitude
    position_horiz_uncert
    position_conf
    position_alt
    position_alt_uncert
    position_gen_time
    mdn
    min

This file should be parsed and stored as is in the ESPOSRSP table in the LPM database.

The next stage (matching) is to match the records in the ESPOSRSP table with the records in the TDR table.  This will be done by matching the `trid` in the ESPOSRSP table with the `trid` in the TDR table along with using a fuzzy timestamp match as trid values are not unique. The matching process will be done multiple times as we can't guarantee that the ESPOSRSP file will be uploaded before the TDR file. The matching process will occur:
    - after the ESPOSRSP file is ingested
    - after the TDR file is ingested
    - on a nightly basis prior to the 4RPO ETL and RunBI processes (TODO: this will need a new story to add a CLI method).
When a match is found, the process will store the associated TDR key and timestamp for each ESPOSRSP row.  Matching rows will create a position record utilizing data from both the TDR and ESPOSRSP tables with a Pos Method of DL (Dispatchable Location).  This new position record will be stored in the normal LTE Position tables.

TODO: Need to add a story to enhance the Location Finder to display the raw data for any positions derived from the ESPOSRSP feed.  Will use a table format similar to the TDR Finder to display the raw data.

- No evidence of modern `password_hash()` or `password_verify()` functions
- 50+ instances of weak hashing algorithms found across the codebase

**Example:**
```php
// Found in multiple files
$password_hash = sha1($password);
$session_token = md5($data);
```

**Impact:**
- Password compromise through rainbow table attacks
- Session hijacking
- Data integrity compromise

**Recommendation:**
- Migrate to PHP's `password_hash()` with ARGON2 or BCRYPT
- Implement proper salt generation

### 5. CORS Configuration with Token Authentication (MEDIUM)

**Risk Level:** Medium  
**CVSS Score:** 5.8

**Description:**
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configured with wildcard (*) allowing requests from any origin. However, the security risk is mitigated by existing token-based authentication system, with planned migration to Azure AD B2C and JWTs.

**Evidence:**
```php
header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *");
```

**Current Architecture Context:**
- **Existing Token System**: Custom token-based authentication already in place
- **Cordova React App**: Runs in WebView, requires CORS consideration
- **Planned Migration**: Azure AD B2C implementation underway
- **JWT Migration**: Second phase to replace custom tokens with JWTs

**Risk Mitigation Factors:**
- Token-based authentication reduces CORS-related risks compared to session-based auth
- Planned Azure AD B2C migration will provide enterprise-grade authentication
- JWT implementation will provide standard, secure token format

**Remaining Security Considerations:**
- CSRF attacks still possible if tokens stored in localStorage/sessionStorage
- Token theft from malicious websites accessing the API
- Potential for API abuse from unauthorized domains

**Current State Assessment:**
Given the token-based authentication, the wildcard CORS policy is **less concerning** than it would be with session-based authentication, but still presents some risk.

**Recommendations by Migration Phase:**

**Phase 1 - Current State (Short-term):**
1. **Validate current token implementation:**
   - Ensure tokens have proper expiration
   - Verify token validation is consistent across all endpoints
   - Check for token storage security (avoid localStorage if possible)

2. **Add request validation beyond CORS:**
   ```php
   // Example: Additional request validation
   if (!validateToken($token) || !validateRequestSignature($request)) {
       // Reject request
   }
   ```

**Phase 2 - Azure AD B2C Implementation:**
1. **Leverage Azure AD B2C features:**
   - Use Azure AD B2C's built-in CORS handling capabilities
   - Implement proper redirect URIs for web clients
   - Configure application registrations with specific domains where possible

2. **Maintain Cordova compatibility:**
   - Register Cordova app as native/mobile app in Azure AD B2C
   - Use PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for mobile app auth flow

**Phase 3 - JWT Implementation:**
1. **JWT Security Best Practices:**
   - Use short-lived access tokens (15-30 minutes)
   - Implement refresh token rotation
   - Store JWTs securely (httpOnly cookies preferred over localStorage)
   - Validate JWT signatures and claims on every request

2. **CORS Strategy with JWTs:**
   ```php
   // Example: More nuanced CORS with JWT validation
   if (validateJWT($jwt) && isValidIssuer($jwt)) {
       // Can be more permissive with CORS when JWT is valid
       header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *");
   } else {
       // Stricter CORS for invalid/missing tokens
   }
   ```

**Long-term CORS Strategy:**
Once Azure AD B2C + JWT migration is complete:
- Consider implementing dynamic CORS based on JWT claims
- Use Azure AD B2C's application registration to control allowed origins
- Implement token-based rate limiting to prevent abuse

### 6. File Upload Security Issues (HIGH)
